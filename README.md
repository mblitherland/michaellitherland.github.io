The site I maintain to showcase my art

## Technical

This is built with Hugo, using the Eternity theme.

When building this in a new environment you need to pull down the submodule for the theme.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

| Current Michael wishes to thank past Michael for the above comment

To install Hugo:

```
sudo apt install hugo
```
