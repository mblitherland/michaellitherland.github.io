## About
Michael Litherland is a nature and landscape artist working in colored pencil, ink, and watercolor. He lives with his wife (an astonishing nature photographer) and their daughter and son in Ohio where we try to get outside and appreciate nature as much as possible. Someday we dream of having a nature preserve and animal rescue of our own where we can host guests and teach and share in art and nature.
